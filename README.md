**NOTE: This module is still in development and may not be fully stable. Use at own risk.**

## Description

Python based Zabbix API utility containing helper functions and CLI capabilities. 

Takes inspiration from existing Python-Zabbix API modules like [lukecyca/pyzabbix](https://github.com/lukecyca/pyzabbix) and [adubkov/py-zabbix](https://github.com/adubkov/py-zabbix). While this module can be used in a similar way, the aim is to add a few out of the box helper functions and CLI handling for a more "batteries included" module.
